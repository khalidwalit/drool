# Project README

This README provides instructions on how to build, run, and containerize the project using Maven, Spring Boot, and Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following software installed on your system:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Maven
- Docker

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to build, run, and containerize the project:

### Run with Maven

You can use Maven to run the project directly. Open a terminal in the project directory and enter the following command:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

This command will download the necessary dependencies, compile the project, and start the Spring Boot application.

Build and Run the JAR
If you prefer to build and run a JAR file, follow these steps:

a. Build the JAR using Maven:

```bash
./mvnw clean package
```

This command will compile the project and package it into a JAR file, which will be located in the target directory.

b. Run the JAR:

```bash
java -jar target/project.jar
```

Replace project.jar with the actual name of the JAR file that was generated.

Dockerize the Application
To containerize the application using Docker, follow these steps:

a. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t project-app .
```

Replace project-app with a suitable name for your Docker image.

b. Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -d --name spring-boot --restart unless-stopped -p 8080:8080 project-app
```

This command will run the Docker container and map port 8080 from the container to port 8080 on your host machine.

Configuration
If the project requires any configuration, provide details in this section. For example, if the application uses a database, provide instructions on how to configure the database connection.

Usage
Explain how users can interact with the project or application. If there are any specific endpoints, APIs, or functionalities, describe them here.

Troubleshooting
If users encounter any common issues or errors, list them here along with their possible solutions. This can include issues related to dependencies, environment setup, Docker, etc.

Contributing
If you welcome contributions to your project, outline guidelines for how other developers can contribute. This might include information about coding standards, pull request processes, and issue tracking.

License
Specify the license under which your project is released. For example:

This project is licensed under the MIT License.

Contact
Provide a way for users to get in touch with you or your team if they have questions, feedback, or need support. This could be an email address, a link to a forum, or any other relevant contact information.
